# The-17th-App-C-Rewrite-
I made a fast food ordering menu simulator in Python four different times, so I decided to try it in C; featuring hotswapping dynamic menus, a hand-made tokenizer/DSL without big external libraries, and more!
It's not done yet, but version 3 is the most done.

Compile it using GCC (or whatever) with the command:
"gcc the_17th_app_v3.c c-ya_tokenizer.c -o the17thv3"
