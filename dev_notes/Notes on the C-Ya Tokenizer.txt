Right now it is 9:32 PM EST, Friday, November 21st, 2025.
I'm trying to figure out the tokenizer I came up with for The 17th App
made in C.
 
Wish me luck.
 
-NT224
 
 

The code has to take "3 lg fry" and convert it into ASCII and perhaps a
digital root.
 
Conceptually, it will look like this:
3 lg fry = 3 211 337
 
Since those are all containable ints, I can then...
uh.
 
Yeah.

read a whole line with fgets()
loop over each character
collect chunks until it hits whitespace
reverse them if scanning backward
compute using ASCII-number-code
look it up in a switch(code) or if (code == X)



Use macro definitions!
Like:
#define LG 211
#define FRIES 337
 
And use arrays!


Make it so that "/" is recognized as an admin command!
/debug
/randomize_order

And so on.






#define ZERO 48
#define ONE 49
#define TWO 50
#define THREE 51
#define FOUR 52
#define FIVE 53
#define SIX 54
#define SEVEN 55
#define EIGHT 56
#define NINE 57





    if (num == ZERO) {
        printf("The original number was 0.");
    }

    else if (num == ONE) {
        printf("The original number was 1.");
    }

    else if (num == TWO) {
        printf("The original number was 2.");
    }

    else if (num == THREE) {
        printf("The original number was 3.");
    }

    else if (num == FOUR) {
        printf("The original number was 4.");
    }

    else if (num == FIVE) {
        printf("The original number was 5.");
    }

    else if (num == SIX) {
        printf("The original number was 6.");
    }

    else if (num == SEVEN) {
        printf("The original number was 7.");
    }

    else if (num == EIGHT) {
        printf("The original number was 8.");
    }

    else if (num == NINE) {
        printf("The original number was 9.");
    }

    else {
        printf("Number not found.");
    }
