# The-17th-App-C-Rewrite-
I made a fast food ordering menu simulator in Python four different times, so I decided to try it in C; featuring hotswapping dynamic menus, a hand-made tokenizer/DSL without big external libraries, and more!
It's not done yet, but version 3 is the most done. 
At the time of typing this (11-29-2025, 4:30 AM EST) versions 1 through 3 were made on and off over a period of eight days, between November 21st, 2025 to November 29th, 2025 (before 6:00 AM). 

Compile it using GCC (or whatever) with the command:
"gcc the_17th_app_v3.c c-ya_tokenizer.c -o the17thv3"
