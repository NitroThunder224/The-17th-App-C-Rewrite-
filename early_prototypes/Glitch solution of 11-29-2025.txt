Okay, the glitch works like this.
If the user types in variations of "menu" ("meun", "sho menu", "sho meun", etc), then the system wrongly adds one wing to the order.

It appears, on surface level, to be triggering the same line each time the code, but if you (like I did) spinkle in the words "APPLE", "BANANA", and "ORANGE" into the code, it reveals an interesting sequence of events.

Since "menu" technically equals "wings" (at the time of typing it is 9:30 PM of 11-29-2025, so I cannot clarify yet if that's correct), then it goes through the "add_items" function.

If the special, macro definition-like word appears in the sequence provided, it hits ORANGE first because it doesn't exist in the order yet.

Once ORANGE is processed, it's now in the order as a semi-invalid ID. Adding more "food" called "menu" or similar proceeds to equal the APPLE variant of adding wings; this is because the semi-invalid ID is in memory of the order, which means it matches the for loop that tries to merge existing items.

The fix was not simple, in fact I need to amend this text file to one day include my solution on another day.

menu is equal to "wing" internally, so that's why people can order "6 piece menus" and get "6 piece wings".
