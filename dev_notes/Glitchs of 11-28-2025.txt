Glitch 1 (fixed within an hour): Override menu can be accessed by saying "no" to the "Do you want to override?" question.

Glitch 2 (fixed within an hour): If "warning mode" is set to "False", then the command "/change_menu" does not work, even though the other commands work.
    Addendum 1: Changing it back to true allows the user to reaccess the "/change_menu" command.
    
Glitch 3 (fixed within an hour): Forgot to actually make everything connected, so I added app.whatever's and app->whatevers when needed.
